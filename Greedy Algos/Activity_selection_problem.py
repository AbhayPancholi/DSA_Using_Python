# can be perfomed by a user. We are provided with the start time (at index 1)
# and end time (at index 2).

# Approach to solve the problem: -
# To solve this problem we see if the end time of the previous activity is less
# than the start time of the current activity. If the condition satisfies we will
# perform the activity else we will go for the next activity
